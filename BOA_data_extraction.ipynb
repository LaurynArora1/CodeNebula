bottleneck values for training images, after distortions.If we're training with distortions like crops, scales, or flips, we have to\\nrecalculate the full model for every image, and so we can't use cached\\nbottleneck values. Instead we find random images for the requested category,\\nrun them through the distortion graph, and then the full graph to get the\\nbottleneck results for each.\\n\\nArgs:\\n  sess: Current TensorFlow Session.\\n  image_lists: Dictionary of training images for each label.\\n  how_many: The integer number of bottleneck values to return.\\n  category: Name string of which set of images to fetch - training, testing,\\n  or validation.\\n  image_dir: Root folder string of the subfolders containing the training\\n  images.\\n  input_jpeg_tensor: The input layer we feed the image data to.\\n  distorted_image: The output node of the distortion graph.\\n  resized_input_tensor: The input node of the recognition graph.\\n  bottleneck_tensor: The bottleneck output layer of the CNN graph.\\n\\nReturns:\\n  List of bottleneck arrays and their corresponding ground truths.\",\n          \"Randomly cropping image around xlabel,ylabel taking into account size of image.Introduced in DLC 2.0 (Nature Protocols paper)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data=data.dropna(subset=[\"docstring\"])"],"metadata":{"id":"I2FY7EeUBlGP"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(data)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"SBHzO7kRBu_X","outputId":"79a443fc-6f18-436e-e813-e5db3465f9aa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708973275823,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":388,"user":{"displayName":"Lauryn Arora","userId":"11174494345020422683"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1476"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"3PJhuB2oBv_0","outputId":"b5bd8c99-d4d9-42c3-a780-47ee2eae9867","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":293},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708973278581,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":438,"user":{"displayName":"Lauryn Arora","userId":"11174494345020422683"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                Repository     Function_Name  \\\n","198  A-bone1/Attention-ocr-Chinese-Version            define   \n","203  A-bone1/Attention-ocr-Chinese-Version     augment_image   \n","204  A-bone1/Attention-ocr-Chinese-Version      central_crop   \n","205  A-bone1/Attention-ocr-Chinese-Version  preprocess_image   \n","206  A-bone1/Attention-ocr-Chinese-Version          get_data   \n","\n","                                         Function_Code  \\\n","198  def define():\\n    \"\"\"Define common flags.\"\"\"\\...   \n","203  def augment_image(image):\\n    \"\"\"Augmentation...   \n","204  def central_crop(image, crop_size):\\n    \"\"\"Re...   \n","205  def preprocess_image(image, augment=False, cen...   \n","206  def get_data(dataset, batch_size, augment=Fals...   \n","\n","                                                  code  \\\n","198  def define():\\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\\n    flags.DEFINE_in...   \n","203  def augment_image(image):\\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\\n    wit...   \n","204  def central_crop(image, crop_size):\\n    \"\"\"\"\"...   \n","205  def preprocess_image(image, augment=False, cen...   \n","206  def get_data(dataset, batch_size, augment=Fals...   \n","\n","                                             docstring  \\\n","198                               Define common flags.   \n","203  Augmentation the image with a random modificat...   \n","204  Returns a central crop for the specified size ...   \n","205  Normalizes image to have values in a narrow ra...   \n","206  Wraps calls to DatasetDataProviders and shuffl...   \n","\n","                                               summary  \n","198                               Define common flags.  \n","203  Augmentation the image with a random modificat...  \n","204  Returns a central crop for the specified size ...  \n","205  Normalizes image to have values in a narrow ra...  \n","206  Wraps calls to DatasetDataProviders and shuffl...
